# Few quick definitions -
#   
# Support - number of times(or percent of times) the antecedent(if) and the consequent(then) occur together. 
#            Can be used to consider only the combinations which occur atleast a certain number of times or with higher frequency.
# Confidence - percent of antecedent(if) transactions that also have the consequent(then) item set or P(C|A) = p(C and A)/P(A) or 
#            number of transactions with both antecedent and consequent/number of transactions with antecedent items
# Lift ratio - We can get higher confidence numbers just because of items which are essentially just picked up without any relevance with other items being picked e.g. milk, bread etc. 
#            Lift ratio is defined as lift(x->y) = support(x and y)/(support(x) * support(y))
# Lift ratio greater than 1 is a good sign of association.
